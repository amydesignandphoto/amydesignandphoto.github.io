For this project you will need a few dev tools that are quite common in the development world.

## Git

The first on is `git`. This will allow you to download the repository onto your machine and to make updates that will very easily end up released to your website.

**Option 1:** The easiest way to make sure it is on your machine is to download XCode. If you download XCode `git` will automatically be downloaded on your machine. It can take several hours to dowload Xcode because it is a large program.

**Option 2:** Another option (the option we did in person) is to download a program called Homebrew(`brew`). You can think of brew as an app store for a ton of developer programs but all the apps(packages) are free. The whole app has names related to brewing beer so if the names confuse you that may be why.

To download brew, go to `https://brew.sh/` and copy the brew long complicated command into your terminal and run it. (Please note, it is VERY dangerous to run random commands off the internet on your computer if you have no clue what they are doing. I know this one very well and I trust it but don't go making a habit of randomly running stuff you see on stack overflow. Its better to ask someone who knows IT just to be safe.)

After running that command and waiting for a while you should have Homebrew. Verify this by typing brew into the command line.

If this does not show up it means we need to add `brew` to your path. After running the install command, `brew` may have a helpful message saying something like "You need to add brew to your PATH, you can do that with this command: `[some command]`". Go ahead and run that or those commands. If that works, go ahead and skip the next section.

## Adding to the Path

If you are struggling to make this work please just give me a call and we can figure it out.

Your computer has a _**LOT**_ of files. Whenever you try to run a command your computer needs to know where to find that command. One option would be to just check every file on the computer for a file that matches the name of the command run. This would make the computer very slow though. Instead the computer has a predetermined set of folders to look in when trying to run a program. This set of folders is known as your PATH. You can look at this

## Node

You can lookup Node JS on google and click on the Node.js link, then the "Download Node JS" button. You can figure out that one from there.

This program will be accessible on the command line as well via two commands:

`node`

and

`npm`

you will use the later most of the time.

## Downloading the Code

Go to the repository on your GitHub.
